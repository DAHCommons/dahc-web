The objective of **Scriptworlds** is to build a new framework within which to think about language, literature and translation and to create a place for literature to find new relevance in the context of the notable advances that have been made in recent years on the neuroscience of reading and in digital technology.

This research will comprise the second part of the **[Prismatic Translation](https://www.creativeml.ox.ac.uk/research/prismatic-translation)** project based at Oxford University and funded by the British AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council).  It is a 4-year grant (2016-2020) and a strand in the **Creative Multilingualism** initiative.

Ethan Turpin uses old and new media technologies to explore human perceptions within large systems.  He is dedicated to making learning spaces where people of all ages can engage in contemplation.  Working as an independent video producer and artist since 1999, his projects have spanned topics such as climate crisis in 3D at The California Museum of Photography, to geometric growth at The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.

In 2017 he installed three interactive “Video Organisms” at the Wolf Museum of Experience and Innovation (MOXI).  In his current collaborations with fire researchers at UCSB’s Bren School for Environmental Science and Management, Ethan films wildfire incidents and produces user-controlled visualizations with support from the National Science Foundation.

Ethan studied sculpture at the Victoria College of Art in Melbourne, Australia and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1997 from the Kansas City Art Institute.
