Wireframe Studio was established to support collaborative and cutting-edge research and teaching in new media, with an emphasis on global human rights, social justice, and environmental concerns. From the outset, we have made UC Santa Barbara students a priority through innovative coursework, design opportunities, and stimulating public programming. Located adjacent to the emerging Digital Arts and Humanities Commons, the studio provides a space for production and critical engagement across media including games, data visualization, installation art, virtual/augmented reality, projection mapping, performance and installation, livestreaming, 3D modeling, mobile apps, and social media. In the future, we hope to expand our programs to provide the latest technologies for both our students in the classroom and interdisciplinary faculty/student research clusters. Through graduate and undergraduate courses; symposia, workshops, and other events; and team-based project development, we envision staging and sharing complex work in environmental and global media, and sparking dialogue among cultural producers, scholars, and activists around the legacies and continued importance of digital media practices.
