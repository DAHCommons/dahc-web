**Calling for proposals for faculty-led open research spaces in the Digital Arts & Humanities Commons (DAHC), an open floor plan interdisciplinary co-working space for digital scholarship, creative practice, and pedagogy located in Music 1410 (formerly the Arts Library).**

This past Fall 2017, the UCSB Division of Humanities & Fine Arts launched the Digital Arts & Humanities Commons. The Commons vision is a vibrant, accessible space for open research and interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. The Commons is home to the Maker Lab, the Religion Experience and Mind Lab, the Scriptworlds project, and the Text Analysis Hackerspace. It also hosts digital culture events for groups such as the Data Science Club and SB Hacks.

The DAHC invites proposals from faculty-led research groups interested in meeting, conducting research, and teaching in the Commons, and in particular in making creative use of space. For example, these may take the form of makerspaces, hackerspaces, digital recording and editing kiosks or open labs. Other on-site engagements include such methods and technical practices as 3D printing, biometrics, motion capture, GIS, sonification, visualization, or text encoding. The space may be used for research projects, classes and class projects, or as a site for conferences and other events. Proposals must identify lead faculty but may involve individuals, groups (including student groups), or whole departments.

The DAHC is located in Music 1410 (formerly the Arts Library), with 4,500 square feet of open floor space zones divided by columns and arranged around a central common area. Proposals with specific floorplan needs should request a space allocation of a 500 square foot zone, 250 square foot half-zone, or 125 foot quarter-zone. For more information, see appendix.

Acceptance of a project proposal to the DAHC will come with reserved area for the project in the Commons, electrical and network access, furnishings (tables, chairs, rugs, lockers, bins), daily open door hours (~9-6) courtesy of the Collaborate-staffed desk at the PrintSpot, laptop and A/V checkout, site support from the Commons graduate research assistant, and availability of the Commons for event programming. In addition to communal whiteboards and monitors, limited funds up to $1000 may be requested for special equipment for a project proposal or group of proposals. Proposals should also emphasize the existing resources they will bring to the space.
