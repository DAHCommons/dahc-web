The [Critical Code Studies Working Group 2018](http://wg18.criticalcodestudies.com) launches today with three weeks (Jan 15 - Feb 5) of discussion about code and society on a variety of issues. Each week features a different theme in CCS scholarship. Over the course of each week, presenters will post up discussion prompts related to that theme.

CCSWG18 will be held in a public-facing forum, so please join us and check out the conversations as they unfold over the next three weeks.
