UCSB's 4th annual Hackathon is scheduled this weekend, January 19th-21st (Fri-Sun). Join us for a weekend of innovation, where the next generation of entrepreneurs and programmers gather at UCSB. Participants code solutions to real-world problems their communities, such as last year's winning app, which created a better way to [hunt for apartments](https://devpost.com/software/apt-get) in the Santa Barbara area.

The goal of this event is to build an entrepreneurial and tech community at Santa Barbara, by connecting students from UCSB and other colleges and giving them the opportunity to learn and develop their coding skills together.
