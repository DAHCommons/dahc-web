The [Critical Code Studies Working Group 2018](http://wg18.criticalcodestudies.com) comes to a close today, after three weeks (Jan 15 - Feb 5) of discussion about code and society. The conversations have been as wide-ranging as they have been thought-provoking, touching on some of the fundamental issues in CCS.

If you'd like to get a snapshot of the conversations or just refresh your memory, the organizers have distributed weekly recaps, in association with [HASTAC](https://www.hastac.org).
