Startup Weekend is a global grassroots movement where anyone can form a team, find an idea and in 54 hours go through the process of creating a startup business and engineering a demo product. Teams pitch their idea to a panel of seasoned investors, and winners will receive various prizes, including $2,000 worth of business consulting. 

In addition to the competition, we will have 3D Printers, and talks on Blockchain and Machine Learning. There will be 7 included meals and lots of snacks! This year's theme focuses on how businesses should solve problems and create positive social impact.
