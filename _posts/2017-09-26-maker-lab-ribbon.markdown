Dear Colleagues, Students, and Friends,

You and your interested colleagues/friends are invited to the ribbon-cutting ceremony and luncheon celebrating the opening of the Maker Lab on Tuesday, September 26th, 11 am. - 1 pm. in Music 1404.

The Maker Lab is part of the larger initiative being launched by Dean John Majewski, called the Digital Arts and Humanities Commons, directed by Jeremy Douglass. DAHC consists of a very large room (most of the former Arts Library) allocated for experimenting and collaborating within and between groups--where the luncheon buffet will be held--and its neighbor "dirty room," the Maker Lab, consisting of the Center for Printing Practice, showcasing the printer of the past, a replica of an early 19th century Albion pull press, replete with the stuff for setting and printing type; a printer of the future, a 3-D printer; and a printer of the "now," punctum press. The concept behind the Maker Lab is to showcase and experiment with the full history of printing from the original-style pull press, to digital printing, to 3-D printing. On the 3-D printer we will be making type and "woodcuts" for printing on the pull press, thus completing the circle of print history.

After the ribbon cutting ceremony you will be given a brief tour of the Maker space and then can alternate between lunch and taking a hand at inking a layout for a flyer of the event--inking the locked-in type with period style inking balls--and pulling a sheet off the press to keep as a memento. Punctum will also be displaying its wide range of exciting publications and forthcoming projects.

We hope to see you there, and do feel free to invite collaborators in thinking about making! If you have any questions about the event, please contact Kristy McCants, the Assistant Director of EBBA, at <kristen.mccants@gmail.com>.

With best wishes
Paddy
