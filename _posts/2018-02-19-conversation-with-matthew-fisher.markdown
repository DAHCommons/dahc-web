The Religion, Experience, and Mind Lab has invited [Professor Mathew Fisher](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/mpaf) to speak on Wednesday, Feb 20, 2-4pm. Professor Fisher will address lay understandings of quantum mechanics and popular (mis)conceptions about potential overlaps with spirituality, introduce us to his hypothesis that the brain may function like a quantum computer, and discuss the idea that [quantum effects may be operative at the biochemical level](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608473/how-quantum-physics-is-about-to-revolutionize-biochemistry/?set=608484) more generally.

The event is intended as an informal discussion of several his articles. We envision it  as a seminar style discussion with those who have read the articles and come with questions for discussion at the table and others who want to listen in on the conversation seated more on the periphery.

This event is open to the public. Those interested in participating in the discussion can request the articles from <nathan_fisher@umail.ucsb.edu>.
